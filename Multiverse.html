<h1>History of the concept</h1>
<p>Early recorded examples of the idea of infinite worlds existed in the philosophy of Ancient Greek Atomism, which proposed that infinite parallel worlds arose from the collision of atoms. In the third century B.C. philosopher Chrysippus suggested that the world eternally expired and regenerated, effectively suggesting the existence of multiple universes across time.[1] The concept of multiple universes became more defined in the middle ages. Fakhr al-Din al-Razi of the Islamic Golden Age, explored the probable existence of the multiverse, based on general principles of the Quran which stated that Allah was "Lord of the Worlds".[2][3]</p>

<p>In Dublin in 1952, Erwin Schr√∂dinger gave a lecture in which he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might "seem lunatic". He said that when his equations seemed to describe several different histories, these were "not alternatives, but all really happen simultaneously".[4]</p>

<p>The American philosopher and psychologist William James used the term "multiverse" in 1895, but in a different context.[5] The term was first used in fiction and in its current physics context by Michael Moorcock in his 1963 SF Adventures novella The Sundered Worlds.</p>

<h1>Brief explanation</h1>
<p>Multiple universes have been hypothesized in cosmology, physics, astronomy, religion, philosophy, transpersonal psychology, music and all kinds of literature, particularly in science fiction, comic books and fantasy. In these contexts, parallel universes are also called "alternate universes", "quantum universes", "interpenetrating dimensions", "parallel universes", "parallel dimensions", "parallel worlds", "parallel realities", "quantum realities", "alternate realities", "alternate timelines", "alternate dimensions" and "dimensional planes".</p>

<p>The physics community has debated the various multiverse theories over time. Prominent physicists are divided about whether any other universes exist outside of our own.</p>

<p>Some physicists say the multiverse is not a legitimate topic of scientific inquiry.[6] Concerns have been raised about whether attempts to exempt the multiverse from experimental verification could erode public confidence in science and ultimately damage the study of fundamental physics.[7] Some have argued that the multiverse is a philosophical notion rather than a scientific hypothesis because it cannot be empirically falsified. The ability to disprove a theory by means of scientific experiment has always been part of the accepted scientific method.[8] Paul Steinhardt has famously argued that no experiment can rule out a theory if the theory provides for all possible outcomes.[9]</p>

<p>In 2007, Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg suggested that if the multiverse existed, "the hope of finding a rational explanation for the precise values of quark masses and other constants of the standard model that we observe in our Big Bang is doomed, for their values would be an accident of the particular part of the multiverse in which we live."[10]</p>
