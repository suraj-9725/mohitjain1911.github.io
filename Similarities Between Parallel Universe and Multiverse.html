<h1>Many Worlds / Infinity Worlds Multiverse</h1>
<p>When people think of the Multiverse / Parallel Universes, the vision that would come to most peoples mind is the Many-Worlds theory but there are other types as well. Lets start with the Many Worlds theory, have you ever wondered if you had made a different decision to the one you had made say last year or the year before that, what would life be like now? There is a theory that there is an alternative universe where that decision was taken. The theory is referred to as the Megaverse, Multiverse, Parallel Universes or Many Worlds Theory amongst others to come. The Multiverse says there are many parallel universes that exists, each one different from the other.</p>

<p>A Parallel World is not time-travel where you can go back in time and change, as it name implies, the other universe is running in parallel at the same time as ours. You can't jump over or someone jump over and tell you what next weeks lottery ticket is.</p>

<p>A parallel universe could probably have the same look and feel as this one but something has changed. The change might be ever so slight as not to notice or one that is totally different. For example, say you walk down the street, you turn left, in the other parallel universe, you will have turned right. That action will determine the order of things. Also known as the Butterfly Effect, the slightest change could have the biggest effect. In our universe, you were born, in the other universe, your parents might have put off having you, you won't exist there.</p>

<h1>What is an Alternate Universe / Reality?</h1>
<p>Alternate Universe is another term to describe another Universe within the Multiverse. Essentially, an Alternate Universe is another way of saying Parallel Universe. An Alternate Reality is an alternate way of things happening now. In an alternate universe, the Earth can be radically different. Author Harry Turttledove writes a lot of stories based around alternate worlds. In the Colonization Quadrilogy, aliens known as the Race gate-crash the Second World War. He has also written novels where weapons of today being used in wars of yesterday.</p>

<p>Some Universes', the changes may be slight, you didn't make a fool of yourself the other night. At the other extreme, Nazi Germany won the Second World War like how Robert Harris envisaged in his book Ref: Fatherland . The television series Sliders starring Jerry O'Connell takes this as its theme as they visit different worlds every episode.</p>

<p>Some times the Multiverse is also known as the Omniverse as it is mentioned in the cartoon Ben 10. Some refer to the Omniverse as being bigger than the Multiverse, encompassing many Multiverses but as Multiverse contains an infinite number of universes, the Omniverse is taking it one step too far.</p>

<p>Your Dreams, a Portal to an Alternate Universe
When you dream at night or daydream, what you see yourself doing could be happening in another universe. Where you dream of winning the lottery, that has already taken place in another universe. Where you dream of being say James Bond, you are that man saving the world from despots. In fact, in one universe, you could be the despot being bought down a peg or two by James Bond.</p>

<p>In the Many-Worlds Multiverse, every possible possibility could be being played out in another universe. The result is mind-blowing to think about. Whilst your dreams could be a reality in the other universe so could your nightmares.</p>
